            <h1>share-this: Medium-like text sharing</h1>
            <p>
                Ever read an article on Medium, and tried to select some text for copy/pasting purposes? I bet you did.
                So you also noticed the little balloon that appears on top of your selection, allowing you to do some nice
                things like highlighting that snippet in a collaborative effort to give it more prominence, or commenting
                on it or share it on Twitter. I think it's a pretty cool feature.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, you may have noticed this is <em>not</em> an article on Medium. We're, in fact, on GitHub pages. It
                <em>looks</em> like Medium, but it's because I'm joking with the styles. So, is that functionality still
                here? Try to select some text.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is! All thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MaxArt2501/share-this"><em>share-this</em></a>, a package I've
                developed with the following principles in mind:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>no dependencies - no jQuery, no icon sets, nothing;</li>
                <li>as much unopinionated as possible, which means:</li>
                <li>it's highly customizable;</li>
                <li>it has a very minimal DOM skeleton;</li>
                <li>its functionality is <em>not</em> predetermined.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I think the first part is quite clear, so let's see the others in detail.</p>

            <h2>Highly customizable</h2>
            <p>
                Being &ldquo;customizable&rdquo; for <em>share-this</em> is something that involves both its general
                appearance and the sharing channels it provides.
            </p>
            <p>
                Altough <em>share-this</em> does come with a curated style sheet that's ready to use and probably fits
                most of a developer's needs, it's <em>not</em> considered a vital part of the library. This means it could
                be completely replaced by something else. It makes use of just a CSS class (<code>share-this-popover</code>,
                but that can be set with the <code>popoverClass</code> setting) that serves as a "namespace" for the style
                rules. No IDs, no attributes, it's all styled on top of the simple popover's DOM structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's also a breakpoint set to a viewport width of less than 576 pixels for a special styling for smaller
                devices like smartphones in portrait mode. It's the same breakpoint of
                <a href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/overview/#responsive-breakpoints">Bootstrap v4 for
                    extra-small devices</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                And if you like the stylesheet provided but you want to tweak some values, you're lucky! Because the library
                provides the sources for the style sheet in both LESS and SCSS format. No magic numbers, you can just
                override the values in the <code>vars</code> file.
            </p>
            <p>
                And what about the sharing channels, usually called &ldquo;sharers&rdquo; throughout the documentation? The
                great news is that you can include the ones that you need, and <em>create</em> your custom sharer! You can
                even enable and disable them at runtime with the <code>active</code> property (being a boolean or a function
                returning a boolean). Finally, you can decide what should happen when clicking/tapping on the buttons with the
                <code>action</code> callback, completely overriding any original behavior.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Minimal DOM skeleton</h2>
            <p>
                This should be pretty straightforward, but this is the complete structure that <em>share-this</em> creates for
                its popovers:
            </p>
            <pre><code>&lt;div class="share-this-popover" style="position: absolute; ...">
    &lt;ul>
        &lt;li data-share-via="...">...&lt;/li>
        ...
    &lt;/ul>
&lt;/div></code></pre>
            <p>
                That's it. Just a <code>div</code> wrapper containing an unordered list (of supposedly sharer buttons), whose
                items have a <code>data-share-via</code> attribute with the sharer's name as the value. What's inside the
                <code>li</code> elements is up to the <code>render</code> method of each single sharer (altough the default
                style sheet presumes it's wrapped in an anchor element). The wrapper (which is <em>not</em> the popover itself,
                but rather a place marker for the selected text) is styled dynamically to set its position in the document.
            </p>
            <p>
                (If you're asking if there are plans to support JSX for the <code>render</code> method, yes, there are.)
            </p>

            <h2>Undetermined behavior</h2>
            <p>
                Everyone expects <em>share-this</em> to just offer text sharing capabilities, as the name implies and actually
                as it <em>does</em> when providing some example sharers. But it's not all the story, here: what a
                &ldquo;sharer&rdquo; can do is actually up to the developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, in this very page the popover provides a
                couple of &ldquo;sharers&rdquo; that actually doen't anything like <em>sharing</em> the selected text. The
                first one allows you to take notes on the article that are saved in the <code>localStorage</code> (they're not
                sent anywhere, and other readers won't see them, don't worry). The other one is something that triggers the
                speech synthesis API to pronounce the selected text (I guess more for fun than for actually learning).
